.SYNOPSIS
    This script downloads Python wheel packages for production and development dependencies.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script ensures a 'wheels' directory exists, then uses pip to download all
    dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt' and 'requirements-dev.txt' into that directory.
    This is useful for creating an offline package cache.
